This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
performance::check_model(exp1alllm)
```


probably analyse 1:2 hard and soft for feeding behaviour 




need to make day a separate variable for separate experiments!! 
maybe?
but it looks like it understands it with emmeans so might be fine 
egg counting data works fine to be combined but are the experiments too different? 



using: 
emmeans::emmeans(exp1bothlm, specs = pairwise ~ diet)
not using day and experiment in the model 


 1:2H - 1:2S   -1.050 0.11 1193  -9.554  <.0001
 
 is the most interesting result 
 
 
 interesting egg results 
 
 if using combined egg data: 

1:8H - 1:8S    -42.8 6.88 75  -6.217  <.0001
 1:2S - 1:8S    -79.2 6.88 75 -11.511  <.0001
 
 much prefer to lay their eggs on a soft diet
