This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

probably analyse 1:2 hard and soft for feeding behaviour 




need to make day a separate variable for separate experiments!! 
maybe?
but it looks like it understands it with emmeans so might be fine 
egg counting data works fine to be combined but are the experiments too different? 



using: 
emmeans::emmeans(exp1bothlm, specs = pairwise ~ diet)
not using day and experiment in the model 


 1:2H - 1:2S   -1.050 0.11 1193  -9.554  <.0001
 
 is the most interesting result 
 
 
 interesting egg results 
 
 if using combined egg data: 

1:8H - 1:8S    -42.8 6.88 75  -6.217  <.0001
 1:2S - 1:8S    -79.2 6.88 75 -11.511  <.0001
 
 much prefer to lay their eggs on a soft diet
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
summary of what has been found 
 
experiment 1a and 1b 
 
feeding 

experiment 1a
day is significant but combined day analysis shows there isn't much preference but 
1:2H is least preferred to all else 

experiment 1b
day is significant but combined day analysis shows they like 1:2S the most and all else is equiv, 1:2H also least preferred 

oviposition
experiment 1a
they prefer to lay their eggs on soft 1:8, then hard 1:8 rather than 1:2 soft or hard 

experiment 1b
they prefer to lay their eggs on soft 1:8, then hard 1:8 rather than 1:2 soft or hard 


experiment 2 

feeding 
day can only just not be used, but they go to 8:1S and 8:1H before they go to 1:2S and 1:2H

oviposition 
they lay their eggs on soft 1:2S then soft 8:1S before they lay their eggs on 1:2H and 8:1H - do not really like this diet at all 

experiment 3 

feeding 
day is significant but combined data analysis shows they like the soft 1:8 and 8:1 equally, then feed on 8:1H a bit after, but 1:8H is much less preferred 


oviposition 
they really like to lay their eggs on 1:8 soft (which was expected), then 8:1 soft, 1:8 hard soon after, but 8:1 hard is not really liked at all
