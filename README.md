A GitHub repistory and R-project including data analysis and visualisation for my third year research project.

This data included follows on from a previous project completed through a summer studentship (Titled: Effects of dietary choice on Lifespan in *Drosophila melanogaster*:  https://github.com/katherinemillar02/effects-of-dietary-choice-on-lifespan-in-drosophila-melanogaster).


This project began with using a 'patch preference assay' to test different food conditions on lifespan and fitness in fruitflies. Using both varying protein: carbohydrate diet patches as well as varying food hardness.

## Description of scripts 

Scripts for each experiment are in sections of: 

**"feeding-overalldiet-analysis"**
This explains scripts with analysis of the feeding observation count data of diets which had both varying P:C ratios and soft and hard foods - before being split into variables. 
For example variables could be: **1:2H, 1:2S, 1:8H, 1:8S**

**"feeding-overalldiet-visualisation"**
This explains scripts with visualisation using barplots of the feeding observation count data of diets which had both varying P:C ratios and soft and hard foods - before being split into variables. 
For example variables could be: **1:2H, 1:2S, 1:8H, 1:8S**

**"feeding-condition-analysis"**
This explains scripts with analysis of the feeding observation count data of diets which had varying P:C ratios and soft and hard foods, split into variables of "Nutrient Composition" (P:C ratios)
and "Food Hardness" (soft and hard foods). 
For example variables could be: **1:2, 1:8, Hard, Soft**

**"feeding-condition-visualisation"**
This explains scripts with visualisation using boxplots and barplots of the feeding observation count data of diets which had varying P:C ratios and soft and hard foods, split into variables of "Nutrient Composition" (P:C ratios) and "Food Hardness" (soft and hard foods). 
For example variables could be: **1:2, 1:8, Hard, Soft**

**"oviposition-overalldiet-analysis"**
This explains scripts with analysis of the oviposition count observation data of diets which had both varying P:C ratios and soft and hard foods - before being split into variables. 
For example variables could be: **1:2H, 1:2S, 1:8H, 1:8S**
