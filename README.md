A GitHub repistory and R-project for my third year research project. 

This is a second part/ follow on from a previous project done in a summer studentship (Effects of dietary choice on Lifespan in *Drosophila melanogaster* - https://github.com/katherinemillar02/effects-of-dietary-choice-on-lifespan-in-drosophila-melanogaster).

This project began with using a 'patch preference assay' to test different food conditions on lifespan and fitness in fruitflies. Using both varying protein: carbohydrate diet patches as well as varying food hardness.

## Description of R Scripts 

**"Experiment1.R" (1:8 and 1:2 hard and soft diets)**

A script with two repeated experiments. This experiment looked at using the protein: carbohydrate ratios 1:8 and 1:2 with both a soft and hard version of each diet, to test whether mated female *drosophila melanogaster* showed a particular preference for a diet. 
The preferred diet in which the *drosophila* chose to lay their eggs was also calculated. 

**"Experiment2.R" (8:1 and 1:2 hard and soft diets)**

An experiment to test a known preferred diet (8:1) with a known least preferred diet (1:2) to see if *drosophila melanogaster* will favour food type over dietary levels.

**"Experiment3.R" (8:1 and 1:8 hard and soft diets)**

Oviposition preference based experiment.
Both feeding behaviour and oviposition preference was measured in this experiment, using a diet which is known that *d. melanogaster* like to lay their eggs on, and a diet which is known to be a least preferred diet for oviposition preference.
