A github repistory and R project for the third year project. 

A second part/ a follow on from a previous project done in a summer studentship (Effects of dietary choice on Lifespan in *Drosophila melanogaster*).

This project involved looking at how different food hardness can affect dietary choice in mated female *drosophila melanogaster*. As well as the effects on fitness and lifespan.
