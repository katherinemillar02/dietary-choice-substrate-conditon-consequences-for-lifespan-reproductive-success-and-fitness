# The effect of mating status and substrate condition on dietary choice and consequences for lifespan and reproductive success.

# Abstract
Lifespan and health span can be influenced by various factors. One of these is the relationship between dietary choice and lifespan which has been extensively studied in various organisms. Dietary choice in Drosophila Melanogaster (D. melanogaster) mated females is influenced by both the Protein:Carbohydrate (P:C) ratio and whether the food is soft or hard. Preferences will also vary based on whether the flies are feeding or laying eggs. These results indicate that flies will mostly prioritise the food texture over nutrient composition, but this came with some exceptions. Flies preferred the nutrient rich diet of 8:1 over 1:2 during feeding, and  1:8 over  8:1 diet during oviposition, the preference for these particular nutrients was more pronounced than the preference for soft food. This study also found that the diet where a D. melanogaster lays their eggs influences the relative gene expression of larvae. Larvae who were reared on a 1:8 hard diet exhibited the highest expression levels when using target genes; drosophila-insulin-like-peptide-3 (dilp3) and drosophila-forkhead-box-O (dFOXO), suggesting that a 1:8 diet may cause nutritional stress, as dFOXO and dilp3 have both been previously linked to nutritional stress. The findings of this study suggest that when given a choice, D. melanogaster may not select diets that are known to be optimal for their lifespan, reproductive success and their offspringâ€™s fitness. 
 

# Project Description

<img title="droso pic" alt="drosopAlt text" src="/images/RLogo.png" width=100 height=100>

A GitHub repistory and R-project including data analysis and visualisation for my third year research project.

This data included follows on from a previous project completed through a summer studentship (Titled: Effects of dietary choice on Lifespan in *Drosophila melanogaster*:  https://github.com/katherinemillar02/effects-of-dietary-choice-on-lifespan-in-drosophila-melanogaster).


This project began with using a 'patch preference assay' to test different food conditions on lifespan and fitness in fruitflies. Using both varying protein: carbohydrate diet patches as well as varying food hardness.

## Description of scripts 

Scripts for each experiment are in sections of: 

**"feeding-overalldiet-analysis"**
This explains scripts with analysis of the feeding observation count data of diets which had both varying P:C ratios and soft and hard foods - before being split into variables. 
For example variables could be: **1:2H, 1:2S, 1:8H, 1:8S**

**"feeding-overalldiet-visualisation"**
This explains scripts with visualisation using barplots of the feeding observation count data of diets which had both varying P:C ratios and soft and hard foods - before being split into variables. 
For example variables could be: **1:2H, 1:2S, 1:8H, 1:8S**

**"feeding-condition-analysis"**
This explains scripts with analysis of the feeding observation count data of diets which had varying P:C ratios and soft and hard foods, split into variables of "Nutrient Composition" (P:C ratios)
and "Food Hardness" (soft and hard foods). 
For example variables could be: **1:2, 1:8, Hard, Soft**

**"feeding-condition-visualisation"**
This explains scripts with visualisation using boxplots and barplots of the feeding observation count data of diets which had varying P:C ratios and soft and hard foods, split into variables of "Nutrient Composition" (P:C ratios) and "Food Hardness" (soft and hard foods). 
For example variables could be: **1:2, 1:8, Hard, Soft**

**"oviposition-overalldiet-analysis"**
This explains scripts with analysis of the oviposition count observation data of diets which had both varying P:C ratios and soft and hard foods - before being split into variables. 
For example variables could be: **1:2H, 1:2S, 1:8H, 1:8S**
