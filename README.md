# The effect of mating status and substrate condition on dietary choice and consequences for lifespan and reproductive success.

# Project Aims 

A GitHub repistory and R-project for my third year research project. 

This is a second part/ follow on from a previous project done in a summer studentship (Effects of dietary choice on Lifespan in *Drosophila melanogaster* - https://github.com/katherinemillar02/effects-of-dietary-choice-on-lifespan-in-drosophila-melanogaster).

This project began with using a 'patch preference assay' to test different food conditions on lifespan and fitness in fruitflies. Using both varying protein: carbohydrate diet patches as well as varying food hardness.
